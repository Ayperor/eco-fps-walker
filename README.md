Artificial intelligence for characters moving in a 3D terrain in Godot.

There are 3 kinds of AI:
* walker_core : It's the core of the bots. This script allows a bot to go from point A to point B, with or without the help of a Navigation node. If there is a navigation node, the bot will follow the path with waypoints and try to avoid being stuck in funny situations generated by the navigation route calculation, such as extra waypoints in opposite direction. If there's no navigation node, the bot will move directly to the target.
